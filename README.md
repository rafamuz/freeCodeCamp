These are the "learning files" for @rafaelmuzel user from freeCodeCamp.org during studies.

Backup of solutions for some of the exercises that I consider most important or are "challenges".

PS: Of course some of the learning steps are very easy or just conceptual, 
so that I donÂ´t upload the files here.
